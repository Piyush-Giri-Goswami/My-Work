        <div class="content"><p>India is gearing up to introduce hydrogen-powered trains as a step toward sustainable and eco-friendly transportation. These trains, part of the Indian Railways' mission to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, will use hydrogen fuel cells that emit only water vapor, replacing polluting diesel engines. With the first prototype expected by 2024, these trains are set to operate on select heritage routes, including the scenic Kalkaâ€“Shimla line, promoting green tourism. This initiative not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also marks a significant stride in advancing clean energy solutions in the transportation sector.</p></div>
